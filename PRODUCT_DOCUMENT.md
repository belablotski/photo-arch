# Product Document: Photo Archive

## 1. Vision

To create an open-source photo archiving solution that allows users to store their photos in a cost-effective way using Azure Blob Storage. The solution will provide a simple and intuitive web interface for users to upload, search, and manage their photos.

## 2. Key Features

*   **Image Upload:** Users can upload their photos to a designated "landing zone" in Azure Blob Storage.
*   **Image Processing:** An automated process will:
    *   Analyze image content and apply relevant tags for searching.
    *   Generate thumbnails for faster browsing.
    *   Move the original images to a long-term storage container.
*   **Search:** A web interface will allow users to search for photos based on tags, dates, and other metadata.
*   **Cost Optimization:** The solution will leverage Azure Storage lifecycle management to move infrequently accessed images to cheaper storage tiers (e.g., Archive tier) to minimize costs.
*   **Photo Gallery:** A visually appealing gallery view of thumbnails will be available for browsing.

## 3. Technical Architecture

*   **Backend:**
    *   Azure Functions for event-driven processing of uploaded images.
    *   Azure Cognitive Services (or other AI services) for image analysis and tagging.
    *   Azure Blob Storage for storing original photos, thumbnails, and metadata.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   A modern web framework (e.g., React, Vue, or Svelte) for the user interface.
    *   The frontend will be hosted as a static website on Azure Blob Storage.
*   **Authentication:**
    *   Azure Active Directory (or other identity providers) for user authentication and authorization.

## 4. North Star

The primary goal is to provide a simple, secure, and cost-effective solution for long-term photo storage. The project will be open-source, encouraging community contributions and transparency.
